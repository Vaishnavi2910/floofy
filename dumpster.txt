                                should be second nature to you nya. If you are confused about something,
                                 then read the servant training manual we will be magnanimously providing to you nya.

                                Hoomans outside our sovereign call us a plebian name called "pets". You better 
                                call us by our rightful name called "floof". There must not be any discrimation
                                 on the basis of the amount of fur we may or may not have, or the chonkiness of our bodies, you furless, flesh-coloured
